Is this covered in the Analytic Geometry course or in Linear Algebra
When we want to work with orthogonalized or orthonormalized vectors, the initial basis will not always meet those criteria

So what this algorithm does is...
We have n vectors in n dimensions that the user will input
Then the orthogonalized vectors will automatically be displayed, obviously having the same nature as the ones entered.
Even if you want to work with them orthonormalized, it will provide that as well.
